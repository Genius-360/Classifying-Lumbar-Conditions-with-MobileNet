## Introduction
With the increasing prevalence of lumbar conditions, effective diagnostic tools are essential. This project leverages MobileNet to classify medical images of lumbar conditions, aiming to assist healthcare professionals in their assessments.

## Related Work
Prior research has shown the efficacy of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in medical image classification. This project builds on existing methodologies by implementing a transfer learning approach using MobileNet, showcasing improved accuracy and efficiency.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Lumbar condition images were collected and preprocessed.
- **Model Architecture:** MobileNet was utilized as the base model, with additional layers added for classification.
- **Training:** The model was trained using data augmentation techniques for better generalization.

## Results
The model achieved:
- **Training Accuracy:** 98.6%
- **Test Accuracy:** 93.1%
- Detailed training history and confusion matrix visualizations were generated to evaluate performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of using MobileNet for classifying lumbar conditions, achieving promising results that can aid in clinical decision-making. Future work may include expanding the dataset and refining the model for further improvements.
